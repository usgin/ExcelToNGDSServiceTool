Excel To NGDS Service Tool

This is a tool for ArcMap which validates and converts a spreadsheet in an Excel file to a NGDS Service. It has primarily been tested in ArcGIS 10.0 but does run in 10.1. Please contact Jessica Alisdairi at jessica.alisdairi@azgs.az.gov with any unexpected errors as we continue to test and make the tool more robust.
